<h1>Version Control Systems</h1>
<p>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if we screw things up or lose files, we can easily recover. In addition, we get all this for very little overhead.</p>

<h2>GIT and GITHUP</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.</p>
<p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface</p>
<br />
<h2>GIT Commands</h2>



<h3>1. Fork</h3>
<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
<h3>2. Commit</h3>
<p>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.</p>
<p>Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository.</p>

<h3>3. Push</h3>
<p>The push command can be considered as a tool to transfer commits between local and remote repositories.It is used to publish new local commits on a remote server.</p>
